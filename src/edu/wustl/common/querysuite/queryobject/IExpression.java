/**
 * A list of operands, and the logical connectors (AND, OR), that together form a
 * logical expression<br> The connectors are identified by the position of the
 * operands on either side, e.g.,
 * <pre> given:  operand connector operand connector operand index:    0        0,
 * 1      1       1,2        2
 * </pre>  An IExpression belongs to a constraint entity; and constraints on
 * another associated entity will be present as a subexpression on the associated
 * entity . <br>Conversely, if an expression has a subexpression, there must an
 * association in the join graph from the parent expression to the subexpression.
 * <br>Note: "subexpression" refers to an operand that is the IExpressionId of the
 * child expression. The entity  of the subexpression will generally be different
 * from the entity  of this expression (exception is when a class is associated to
 * itself, e.g. Specimen). <br>The expression for an expressionId is found from
 * {@link edu.wustl.common.querysuite.queryobject.IConstraints}.
 * @see edu.wustl.common.querysuite.queryobject.IJoinGraph
